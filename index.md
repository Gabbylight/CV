<p><h2><u>Intro:</u></h2>
  <h4>Hi there everyone and welcome to my Blog! As you guys already know I paint majority Halo Figures! Primarily Jazwares Halo Figures
  not Mcfarlane! But for those that are new... I basically buy the said figures I need, evaluate them and see what needs to be done and custom it!</h4>
  <br>
  <h3><u>What I Do with my Customs!</u>
  <h4> I normally prep my work bench, like for example! I would examine the Spartan that I recently bought, evaluate what I want it to be. If i want it
  be a Heavy Trooper or a Sniper. Once thats done, I work my way using the internet and find the files I need for my Spartan. Once thats done, I dowbload the file
put it Blender and play around with the file and add some details. Like add a knife between the armor section of the Spartan</h4>

<h4> If anyone is interested, I'll have a link of all my work/projects I worked on!</h4><hr size"3">
